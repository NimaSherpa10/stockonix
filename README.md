#### `Project Detail'`

This software system is aim to provide a stock tracking application intended for use by stock
market investors. The system is designed to optimize an investor's workflow by saving them
valuable time by monitoring specific stocks and additional important metrics. It is accomplished
by providing a dashboard that will allow them to monitor stocks in real-time. Without this type of
application, the investor would be forced to individually monitor stocks and relevant metrics through their
own chosen domain which would drastically increase the amount of time it takes to track their interested
stocks. By allowing the investor's workflow, the system will come to meet the needs of the everyday
investor through an easy-to-use application.
Moreover, this application is designed to provide an interactive dashboard that allows the
investor to add, remove, and edit up to 10 different stocks that will be represented as widgets. These
widgets  showcases the stocks information, and when pressed will navigate the user to a secondary
page. On this secondary page, additional stock metrics is displayed along with an interactive chart
that will show the historical price data of the stock. This chart will provide an adjustable time interval in
which it can be changed by client interaction.
